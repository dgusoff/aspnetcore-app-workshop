# ASP.NET Core - App Building Workshop

## Setup

[Download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and install the .NET Core SDK and Visual Studio.

> Note: When installing Visual Studio you only need to install the `ASP.NET and web development` workload.

If you have issues downloading the installers we may have USB sticks with offline installers for you to use.

## What you'll be building
In this workshop, you'll learn by building a full-featured ASP.NET Core application from scratch. We'll start from File/ New and build up to an API back-end application, a web front-end application, and a common library for shared data transfer objects using .NET Standard.
